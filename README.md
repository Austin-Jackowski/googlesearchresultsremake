# googlesearchresultsremake
Remake of the google search results first page. Nothing dynamic yet.

I am making this remake of the google search results page using a slightly different methodology than before. I planned everything out on paper before hand, and have tried to create a preliminary semantic structure to organize each section of the page before beginning. I think this will streamline the process a bit more, and let me plan out the semantics more efficiently than before.
